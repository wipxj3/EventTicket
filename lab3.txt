Sergiu Crucerescu refactored the code of the function register_view(request), located in EventTicket/ticket/views.py.
Now there are two functions: bad_register_view(request) and register_view(request). The first one has comments that say 
what refactoring pattern should be applied to the code that follows. The second one has the refactoring patterns applied
and is the working function.
Marta Igor refactored the code in EventTicket/request/qr.py. The applied patterns are indicated in comments, as well as the code before and after.
